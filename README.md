# General_BNC_PCB
General PCB which contains 6 BNCs, and will be used for a variety of different circuits to supply input and produce output.

## Use
This board is a very simple board, meant to be used for many different circuits. Essentially, the value of this circuit is to have a single standard board of BNC's for future use.

## Images
Images will be uploaded later to demonstrate examples of when this board is used, and how it was used

## FreeCAD
There is not a fixed FreeCAD design for this board since it depends on how many an individual circuit may use, however, a FreeCAD design meant for this board will be uploaded soon as a reference as to how it can be made

## Gimp
There will not be a Gimp file for this since it will have different labels for different circuits, however, a generic Gimp file will be uploaded so that the title for each BMC can be changed, but the location of the title is already verified.
